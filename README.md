# Famous algorithms implemented in Python
Python implementation of various famous algorithms. Inspired by the Coursera [**"Algorithms Specialisation"**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) by Stanford University. 
* Karatsuba multiplication (`karatsuba_multiplication.py`)
* Counting the number of inversions performed by the merge sort algorithm (`merge_sort_counting_inversions.py`)
* Counting the number of comparisons performed by the quick sort algorithm (`quick_sort_comparisons.py`)
* Computing the min cut of a graph (`minimum_cut_graph.py`)
